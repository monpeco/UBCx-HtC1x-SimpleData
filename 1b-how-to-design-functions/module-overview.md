#How to Design Functions

###How to Design Functions

This module is where this course starts to differ from other introductory programming courses—we are going to start learning the design method, and this should be new material even for people who have programmed before.

###Learning Goals

Be able to use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design functions that operate on primitive data.
Be able to read a complete function design and identify its different elements.
Be able to evaluate the different elements for clarity, simplicity and consistency with each other.
Be able to evaluate the entire design for how well it solves the given problem.
Hints About this Material

We repeat the advice that this is material you learn by doing: for each video you should download the starter file and type along with the video. Or you can pause the video occasionally and try to work ahead, then restart the video and compare what you did to what happened in the video.

At first the HtDF recipe may seem like overkill, or it may seem overwhelming. You may suspect that these functions could be written more quickly without the recipe. You are right! Design methods often make simple problems harder to solve. Right now we are using simple problems to learn how to use the design method. This will pay you back later by making really hard problems much easier to solve.

###Planning Your Time

Working through the videos and practice materials for this module should take approximately 4-7 hours of dedicated time to complete.

NOTE: To help you master the design method, much of the video material consists of the instructor working through a complete design step-by-step. As a result, in most of the videos, at least part of the material is essentially review, with new points interspersed throughout. We could have made the videos shorter by just including the 'new parts' for each video. But students have told us that it is more helpful to see the new material in context, as part of complete design problems. So, in most videos, some of the material will be review and some of it will be new. This means, there are more minutes of video than there are minutes of new material.
